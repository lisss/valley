# 🎬 The Valley - Quick Start Guide

Your Hitchcock-style horror quest is ready! Here's everything you need to know.

## 🎯 What You Have

✅ A complete Next.js web application  
✅ 6 challenging puzzle stages  
✅ Hitchcock-inspired psychological horror theme  
✅ Dark, atmospheric design with animations  
✅ Git repository initialized with 2 commits  
✅ Ready for GitHub and Vercel deployment  

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
cd /Users/liss/Work/Dev/Git/valley
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to test the quest.

### 2. Create GitHub Repository

**I cannot create the GitHub repo automatically** (no GitHub CLI detected), but it's easy:

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Name: `valley`
3. Don't initialize with anything
4. Click "Create repository"
5. Then run:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/valley.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel

Easiest method:
1. Go to: https://vercel.com
2. Click "Add New Project"
3. Import your `valley` repository
4. Click "Deploy" (Vercel auto-detects Next.js)
5. Done! You'll get a URL like: `valley.vercel.app`

## 🎮 The Quest

Your husband will encounter:

1. **The Letter** - Caesar cipher puzzle (Edgar Allan Poe reference)
2. **The Courtyard** - A riddle about echoes
3. **The Hallway** - Morse code translation
4. **The Basement** - Hitchcock's "The Birds" counting puzzle
5. **The Hidden Room** - Reverse text cipher
6. **The Heart** - Final psychological revelation

**Estimated Time:** 30-60 minutes (challenging!)
